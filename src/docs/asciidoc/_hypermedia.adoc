== Hypermedia & Hypertext

NOTE: How old are the terms hypermedia and hypertext?

[quote,Ted Nelson, 1963]
Hypertexts: new forms of writing, appearing on computer screens, that will branch or perform at the readerâ€™s command. A hypertext is a non-sequential piece of writing; only the computer display makes it practical.

=== Hypermedia & Hypertext

NOTE: actually, it all goes even back to the 40ties and the memex ðŸ˜±

* essential is the non-linear branching model
* links between hypermedia documents

== HTML

* HTML is the most widely used form of hypermedia
* Invented by Tim-Berners Lee in the 90ties
* Today more or less "everywhere"
* only two elements: anchor and form

=== HTML Anchor

[source,html]

<a href="https://www.javaland.eu">
  Javaland
</a>
----

[%step]
* What does it mean and do?
* Show `Javaland` is clickable
* Issue a request to `https://www.javaland.eu`
* Replace the entire screen with the response body

=== HTML Form

[source,html]
----
<form action="/signup" method="post">
  <input type="text" name="email" 
  placeholder="Enter Email To Sign Up..."/>
  <button>Sign Up</button>
</form>
----

* Show a text input and a `Sign Up` button
* When form is submitted issue a Post request to the server
* Replace the entire screen with the response bodyfootnote:disclaimer[Actually a little simplified]

=== What about REST and SPA?

* Anchor and Form have been enough to make the web grow 
* Json Data API + SPA are *not hypermedia*
* HTML has stopped evolving as a *hypermedia*

=== HTML as Hypermedia

What would have happened if HTML has evolved as *hypermedia*? ðŸ¤”

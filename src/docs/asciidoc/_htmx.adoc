== HTMX

[NOTE]
Why should only `<a>` and `<form>` be able to make HTTP requests?

[NOTE]
Why should only `click` & `submit` events trigger them?

[NOTE]
Why should only `GET` & `POST` methods be available?

[NOTE]
Why should you only be able to replace the entire screen?

=== Fun Fact

[IMPORTANT] 
==== 
HTMX is the sucessor of intercooler.js. 
Intercooler.js started 2013/2014 with *exact* the same approach, but didn't get much traction.
Somehow this is different now with HTMX. ðŸ¤·

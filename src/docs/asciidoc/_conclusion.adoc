== Conlusion

* Hypermedia driven applications are a viable alternative to omnipresent SPAs
* Reduce complexity 
* At least opens the way to progressive enhancement

=== Good Fit

* Form based ("enterprise") applications
* CRUD frontends
* e-commerce frontends

=== Maybe not a good idea

* Something like google docs, maps
* Heavy interaction
* *But* for sure you can combine the two approaches
